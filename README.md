# A Blog Starter App

Homework #3: Cool Looking Blog with Firebase

## Description

This is a trivial blog app, started with Vite. It works entirely within memory, so reloads blow everything away except for the first two mock articles. This is a visually pleasing/modern take on the ancient art form called "The Blog." The user is able to log in to their google account to secure their posts while still enabeling others to view your deep thoughts.
